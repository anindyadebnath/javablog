    <h2>What is Stream?</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul class="ad-p">
        <li>Stream is a sort of Itarator. Stream is abstraction which represents zero or more values.</li>
        <li>Stream is not a Collection. Valuse might not be stored.</li>
        <li>It represents sequence of elements which supports sequential or parallel operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>What is Stream Pipeline?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="ad-p">To perform a task over a source, stream operations are composed into a stream pipeline.  A Stream Pipeline is composed of</p>
    <ul class="ad-p">
        <li>A Source (Source might be a collection, an array, an I/O channel etc)</li>
        <li>zero or more intermediate operations.</li>
        <li>and a terminal operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ad-p">Below is an example of Stream Pipeline.</p>

    <h2>How to find distinct element from a stream.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="ad-p">To get distinct element from a stream we have to override equals and hashCode function. For all of the stream example we will be using Student Object which has
        attribute like int id, String userName, int standard. We are not going to cover how to write equals and hashCode here. Our main goal is to learn stream API.</p>
    <p class="ad-p">I have added equals function based on id and standard, which means we will not allow duplicate id for same standard.</p>
    <pre style="width: 700px">
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> distStudents= students.stream()
                                        .distinct()
                                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p">First line we have fetched all students data and stored in a List. In second line we have created a stream by calling <code>students.stream()</code>. <br>
    Next we have applied an aggregate function <code>distinct()</code> which will return a stream of distinct students based on our equals and hashCode. <br>
    at last we are calling a terminal operation to return back our stream as a Student List.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to filter out element from a stream.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="ad-p">Assume we want to filter out the High School Students from our Students List. We have added below static function to check whether Student is High school Student or not.</p>
    <pre>
    <span class="java-key">public static boolean</span> isHighSchoolStudent(Student student) {{oC}}
        <span class="java-key">return</span> (student.standard>10)?<span class="java-key">true</span>:<span class="java-key">false</span>;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p">Let's find out all High School Students from the Student List.</p>
    <pre>
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> highSchoolStudents= students.stream()
                                              .filter(Student::isHighSchoolStudent)
                                              .collect(Collectors.toList()); 
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p"><code>fileter()</code> function expects a Predicate as argument. We already cover what is predicate and how to use that.
    Here we have used Method Reference to filter out all High School Students.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to modify element and extract from a stream using map.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="ad-p">Assume we need all High School student name in Upper Case. Let's modify our code.</p>
    <pre>
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> highSchoolStudents= students.stream()
                                                .filter(Student::isHighSchoolStudent)
                                                .map(elt->{{oC}}
                                                    elt.setUserName(elt.getUserName().toUpperCase());
                                                    <span class="java-key">return</span> elt;
                                                })
                                                .collect(Collectors.toList());   
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p"><code>map()</code>expects a <code>Function</code> (Please visit <a href="#/method-reference">method reference</a> to know more about function), we have implemented this function such a way that it returns
     a student object after modification.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>How to know which element passed a certain point in a pipeline.</h2>
     <hr>
     <p class="ad-p">In real life we need to debug to track the status of an object and Stream API provides such as function <code>peek()</code>, which allows to see
     object status or which object is picked up for a certain operation.</p>
     <p class="ad-p"><code>toString()</code> has been added to know the details of the Student Object.</p>
     <pre>
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> distStudents= students.stream()
                                        .distinct()
                                        .peek(elt->System.out.println(elt))
                                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
     </pre>
     <p class="ad-p"><code>peek()</code> function expects a <code>Consumer</code>(Please visit <a href="#/supplier-consumer-predicate">supplier-consumer-predicate</a> to know more about Consumer) as argument, which means modifaction is not allowed.
    This is a very handy function for debuging purpose.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to sort using sorted function from stream API.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="ad-p">In Stream API we have two function to get sorted stream.</p>
    <ul class="ad-p" style="color: #337ab7">
        <li>sorted( )</li>
        <li>sorted(Comparator)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ad-p">Let's first start with <code>sorted()</code> without argument. To get sorted stream for Student Object our Student class should have implementation of <code>Comparable</code> Interface. 
    Please add below code snippet to your Student class.</p>
    <pre>
    @Override
    <span class="java-key">public int</span> compareTo(Student o) {{oC}}
        <span class="java-key">if</span>(id==o.id)
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 0;
        <span class="java-key">else if</span>(id>o.id)
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 1;
        <span class="java-key">else</span>
            <span class="java-key">return</span> -1;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p">We wil be sorting our students in ascending order based on their id.</p>
    <pre>
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> soertedStudents= students.stream()
                                            .sorted()
                                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    </pre>
    <p class="ad-p">I personally don't recommend this function (with out argument) for sorting. Because, if we want to change our sorting criteria we need to change 
        <code>compareTo</code> function again. Moreover multiple sorting critaria can not be implemented. We will see the example very soon.</p>
    <p class="ad-p">Now, delete the Comparable implementation which we have added before. We will see how to use Comparator as an argument of sorted function. <br>
    We will create two comparator one is standardCompare and another is idCompare like below.</p>
    <pre>
    Comparator{{oA}}Student> standardCompare=(s1,s2)->{{oC}}
        <span class="java-key">if</span>(s1.getStandard()==s2.getStandard())
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 0;
        <span class="java-key">else if</span>(s1.getStandard()>s2.getStandard())
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 1;
        <span class="java-key">else</span>
            <span class="java-key">return</span> -1;
        };
        
    Comparator{{oA}}Student> idCompare=(s1,s2)->{{oC}}
        <span class="java-key">if</span>(s1.getId()==s2.getId())
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 0;
        <span class="java-key">else if</span>(s1.getId()>s2.getId())
            <span class="java-key">return</span> 1;
        <span class="java-key">else</span>
            <span class="java-key">return</span> -1;
    };
    </pre>
<p class="ad-p">Assume, we want sorting of id will be according to the standard of student. Which means we will first sort according to the standard then id.</p>
<pre>
    List{{oA}}Student> students=StudentFactory.getStudents();
    List{{oA}}Student> students1= students.stream()
                                    .sorted(standardCompare.thenComparing(idCompare))
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());   
</pre>
<p class="ad-p">See, How easy it is to sort by stream.</p>
